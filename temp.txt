I now want to make the AbonnementsSection. This section should list all the people that have their abonnement using ant design table. It should list the name last name groupe if there is one, the number of BDs they have rented ie the number of BDs in the locations table with their mid that dont have a "fin" date. The row should be clickable and the pages should be 50 people max with pages. Once a row is clicked, it should replace the table with on one part all of the information of the person. This information should be editable if we click on a edit button and saved once we click on save. Have a popup come up if we try to do something else without having saved a change. Underneath should be a list of the books that that member has rented ie the BDs in the locations table with their mid. The row should have a button when a member returns a book. This then adds the "fin" date to the current timestamp in the locations table (through an api call. The call should only be doable if signed in as admin). Under that should be a search bar with a list of 50 bds (again using a ant table with pages). The row of a BD should have a button to add this BD to the member. This add a row to the locations table with the necessary information.
